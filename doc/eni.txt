\section eni Basic ENI support

With the supplied Python script "eniconv.py", it is possible to extract the CoE
initialization commands from an ENI file, and make them available to SOEM, as a
C file that can be compiled and linked together with the SOEM application.
The generated C file defines the (extern) variable "ec_eni", which can be used
to initializethe "ENI" field of the appropriate "ecx_contextt" instance, before
calling the "ec_config_map" function (or equivalent, depending on the
application).

Currently, the main goal of this is to support PDO mapping and assignment.
This means that some information that is mandatory in an ENI file is simply
ignored by the conversion program. The included "sample-eni.xml" minimal ENI
file example has been provided, together with the generated "sample-eni.c" file,
for a quick review of what gets extracted, and how it ends up as C data.
